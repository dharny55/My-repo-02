Day two of five days challenge. 
On this day, I created my second repository.
After the third day being tomorrow, I'll make changes to this files from my local machine and push all changes back to the server.
Today, I'll simply pull this new repo to my local machine where I'll make the above mentioned changes using the CLONE command in git bash...This should be more fun I guess.
I wasn't afraid to make my first commit...hahahaha. just come to think of it, i didn't even commit a SIN afterall...😂 
I should be happy to get to that point, let's see by tomorrow how much that will mean.
